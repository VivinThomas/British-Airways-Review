# British-Airways-Review

This project focuses on analyzing British Airways review data using data visualization techniques. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and underwent data preprocessing to ensure data integrity. Subsequently, a comprehensive British Airways Review Dashboard was created using Tableau.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises British Airways review data, including information such as date, travel type, seat type, aircraft group, continent, and various review metrics such as overall rating, cabin staff service, food quality, entertainment, ground service, and seat comfort.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Checked for missing values and data inconsistencies.
   - Ensured data quality by handling null values and other types of errors.

2. **Data Visualization with Tableau**:
   - Created an interactive British Airways Review Dashboard with multiple filters to provide users with flexibility in data exploration.
   - The dashboard includes the following main filters:
   
     - **Metric Selector**: Provides users with the option to select the metric for analysis (e.g., overall rating, cabin staff service, food quality, entertainment, ground service, seat comfort).
     - **Time Duration Selector**: Enables users to select the month of the date for analysis.
     - **Travel Type Selector**: Allows users to filter data based on travel type.
     - **Seat Type Selector**: Enables users to filter data based on seat type.
     - **Aircraft Group Selector**: Allows users to filter data based on aircraft group.
     - **Continent Selector**: Enables users to filter data based on the continent.
  
4. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
   - Seven KPIs are included at the top of the dashboard, providing users with a quick overview of key metrics:
     - Average Rating
     - Average Cabin Staff Service
     - Average Ground Service
     - Average Seat Comfort
     - Average Value for Money
     - Average Food & Beverages
     - Average Entertainment

5. **Visualizations**:
   - The dashboard includes four main visualizations:
   
     - **Average Metric by Month**: Displays the average selected metric by month (e.g., average overall rating by month).
     - **Average Metric by Country**: Illustrates the average selected metric by country (e.g., average overall rating by country).
     - **Average Metric by Aircraft (Overall Ratings)**: Shows the average selected metric by aircraft based on overall ratings.
     - **Average Metric by Aircraft (Number of Reviews)**: Displays the average selected metric by aircraft based on the number of reviews.
